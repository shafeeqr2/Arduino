# Arduino-Sensor-Data-Collection-in-MS-Excel

This project shows how sensor data can be collected from an Arduino from diffierent sensors and displayed graphically into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in realtime.

Rather than constantly logging data, the arduino will only log data once there has been a significant change as means of storing space.
